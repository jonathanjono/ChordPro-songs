{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Db] As I reflect I find perspective
[Db] There in the best and worst days [Absus]of this [Gbmaj7]life,
You were always on my side
[Db] You're in the pain, You're in the promise
[Db] And on the days the furnace [Absus]finds my [Gbmaj7]faith
You're the fourth within the flames
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge: Pre-Chorus}
I don't [Bbm7]need to know what the future says
'Cause if the [Absus]past could talk, it would tell me this
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
My [Gb]God isn't finished [Db]yet
If he did [Bbm]it before, He can do [Ab]it again
So i'll [Gb]trust Him with what comes [Db]next
For the [Bbm]God I know is [Ab]known for faithfulness
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
[Gb] [Db] Yeah, my [Bbm]hindsight says, I can [Ab]trust Him with what's next
[Gb] [Db] For the [Bbm]God I know is [Ab]known, for faithful[Db]ness

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Db] There's more ahead, than what's behind me
'Cause through the highs and lows
And [Absus]in be[Gbmaj7]tween, God You go ahead of me
[Db] And where You call me I will follow
If the water folds beneath [Absus]my feet[Gb]
Then You'll pull me from the deep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge: Pre-Chorus}
I don't [Absus]need to know what the future says
[Bbm] 'Cause if the [Gb5]past could talk, it would tell me this[Db]
My [Gb]God isn't finished [Db]yet
If he did [Bbm]it before, He can do [Ab]it again
So I'll [Gb]trust Him with what comes [Db]next
'Cause my [Bbm]hindsight says I can [Ab]count on this
