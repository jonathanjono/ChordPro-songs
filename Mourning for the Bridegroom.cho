There is coming a day when the Bridegroom is taken away
And in that day they will mourn; in that day they will fast
Things as they are are not okay
When Someone is missing, Someone is absent
I'll stay here and mourn for You, I'll stay here and fast for You
I'll stay here and watch for You, I'll stay here and wait for You
Things are not okay right now, things are not okay right now
Things are not okay right now, things are not okay right now
And they won't be till You come back
And they won't be till You come back
I will embrace the ache of a lovesick heart
I will embrace the ache of a lovesick heart
