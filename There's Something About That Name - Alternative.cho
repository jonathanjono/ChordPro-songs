{key: G}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Jesus, [G7sus]Jesus, [Em]Jesus
There's just [C]something a[D]bout that [G]name [G7sus] [Em]
[G]Master, [G7sus]Saviour, [Em]Jesus
Like the [Am7]fragrance after the [D]rain
[G]Jesus, [G7sus]Jesus, [Em]Jesus
Let all [C]Heaven and [D]Earth [Bm]proclaim
[E]Kings and [E7]kingdoms
Will [A7]all pass away
But there's [C]something [D]about that [G]Name.
