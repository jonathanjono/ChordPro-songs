{start_of_verse}
It’s not by [Em]might nor [G]power
[C]But by my [D]Spirit says the [Em]Lord.[G] [D]
[A]
It’s not by [Em]might nor [G]power
But by my [A]Spirit says the [Bsus]Lord.
And all the [Em]kingdoms shall topple
And the [G]deaf shall [A]hear
And the [C]blind shall [Bsus]see.
It’s not by [Em]might nor [G]power
[D]But by my [A]Spirit says the Lord, says the [C]Lord
[D]
Says the [C]Lord[D]
