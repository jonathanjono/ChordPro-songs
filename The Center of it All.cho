{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
From the [G#m7]coolness of the [F#sus]garden
To the [E2]chaos of the fa[B]ll
When we [G#m7]saw the Red Sea pa[F#sus]rted
And Jericho's [E2]tumbling wa[B]lls
A love was [G#m7]leading us to [F#sus]freedom
You were [E2]teaching us Your so[B]ng
Through [G#m7]every page of [F#sus]history
You're [E2]right where You belong

{start_of_chorus}
From the [G#m7]beginning to the [F#sus]ending
You're the [E2]center of it [B]all
It's [G#m7]for You and it's [F#sus]from You
[E2]You and You a[B]lone
The [E2]Author of our [B]story
Let it [G#m7]all be for Your [F#sus]glory
From the [G#m7]beginning to the [F#sus]ending
You're the [E2]center of it all
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From the [G#m7]promise of the [F#sus]prophets
[E2]To the virgin bi[B]rth
The [G#m7]one who healed the [F#sus]blind man
Was the [E2]King that came to se[B]rve
On a [G#m7]cross, You bore my [F#sus]burden
Took my [E2]sin down to the gr[B]ave
And [E2]on that Sunday [B]morning
You [F#sus]rolled the stone awa[B]y

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And the [G#m7]tears that we've been cr[F#(add4)]ying
You're [E2]gonna wipe awa[B]y
When You [G#m7]call us home to he[F#(add4)]aven
And we [E2]see You face to fa[B]ce
We will [G#m7]join the saints and a[F#(add4)]ngels
We will [E2]raise a victory so[B]ng
Singing [G#m7]Holy, Holy, H[F#(add4)]oly
To the [E2]center of it [B]all [B]
From the [G#m7]beginning to the [F#sus]ending
You're the [E2]center of it [B]all
It's [G#m7]for You and it's [F#sus]from You
[E2]You and You a[B]lone
The [E2]Author of our [B]story
Let it [G#m7]all be for Your [F#sus]glory
From the [G#m7]beginning to the [F#sus]ending
You're the [E2]center of it [B]all
