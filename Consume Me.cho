{start_of_chorus}
[Em]Consume m[Cmaj7]e [E]oh Lord my [D]God x4
For Your [Em]ways are better than [D]my ways
And Your [Am]thoughts much higher than [D]mine
And the [Em]life You give is much [Am]stronger
Than any[Cmaj7]thing that I hold onto Any[Fmaj7b5]thing I leave behind
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
To unders[Em]tand is better than [D]silver
And Your [Am]wisdom much finer than [D]gold
And the [Em]light You give is far [Am]brighter
Than any [Cmaj7]darkness that surrounds me Than any[Fmaj7b5]thing that might take hold
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[Am7]Let me dwell within Your [Em7]presence
[Cmaj7]Let me know Your [D]ways
[Am7]Let me learn to let [Em7]go of my will
Let me [Cmaj7]drown within the river that is fl[Fmaj7b5]owing from Your Hear
{end_of_bridge}
