{start_of_verse}
As I [C#m11]come into Your presence
[A2]Past the gates of praise
In[C#m11]to Your sanctuary
Til we're [A2]standing face to face
I [Bsus]look upon Your count[B]enance
I see the [C#m]fullness [B]of Your [A2]grace, [E/G#]
And I can [F#m7]only bow [E/G#]down [Amaj7]and [Bsus]say. [B]
Chorus
You are [Esus]awesome in this place, [E] Mighty [F#m7]God
You are [A]awesome in this pl[A/B]ace, Abba [E]Father[A/B]
You are [E]worthy of all praise,
To [A2]You our lives we [F#m7]raise
You are [A]awesome in this place, [Amaj7/B]Mighty [E]God
