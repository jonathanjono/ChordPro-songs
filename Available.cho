[E] If it seems like we're going places we've never been
[F#m] Like we've left all we know to chase a voice on the [C#m]wind
We're not lost, [A]we're just looking for [E]you
[E] If it looks like we've lost all composure and pride

If we seem desperate, it's [A]just cause it's [E]true

[E] If it sounds like your kingdom's all we're talking about
[F#m]If sounds like we've tuned all the other noise [C#m]out
We're just listening, we're just [A]listening for [E]you
[E]And if our praise and our prayers seem outrageous and bold
[F#m]If our worship gets too big for one building to [C#m]hold
We're not making a show, we're just[A] making [E]room
