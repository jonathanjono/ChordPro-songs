No I won[E]'t be afraid,
You are with[A] me
You are righ[E]t beside me,
Every[A]day
Even whe[E]n it feels like,
everything is go[A]ing wrong
I can [E]look up to You God,
and find my st[A]rength
O[E]h [B]oh [E]oh
[A]Your love has lifted me
O[E]h [B]oh [E]oh
[A]Above the raging sea
O[E]h [B]oh [E]oh
[A]And I just gotta say
O[E]h [B]oh [E]oh

I was lo[E]st and afraid
Until You foun[A]d me

You go with [A]me
Lord You gi[E]ve me the courage
To live each [A]day
