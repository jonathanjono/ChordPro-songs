[F]Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
on a bright Hawaiian Christmas [C7]day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees [F]sway
[F7]Here we know that Christmas will be [Bb]green and bright
The [D7]sun will shine by day and all the [G7]stars at [C7]night
[F]Mele Kalikimaka is Ha[F7]waii's [D7]way to [G7]say Merry [C7]Christmas to [F]you
