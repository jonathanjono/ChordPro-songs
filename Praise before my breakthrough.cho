{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[E/G#] I know the tension of the n[A2(no3)]ow
I don't always under[E/B]stand
I don't always get to [A2(no3)]see
Everyth[E/G#]ing
When I'm holding up my ha[A2(no3)]nds
When I'm counting every brea[E/B]th
Lord, all I need to kn[A2(no3)]ow is
You choose me [E/G#]
You choose me[A2(no3)]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I'll [E]praise before my breakthrough[A2]
â€˜Til my [E/G#]song becomes my triumph[A2]
I will [C#m7]sing because I trust You[A2]
I will bring my he[E/G#]art
I will lift my s[A2]ong
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[E/G#] When I'm listening for Your voice[A2(no3)]
And I'm shutting out the no[E/B]ise
I know that you will sp[A2(no3)]eak
Clear[E/G#]ly
When I'm living out my fa[A2(no3)]ith
When I'm stepping on the s[E/B]ea
I know You take my h[A2(no3)]and
And walk with [E/G#]me
Walk with [A2(no3)]me

Won't He [A2(no3)]raise again
And I will si[E/B]ng
I will [A2(no3)]sing
