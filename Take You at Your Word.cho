{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Your [D]word is a [Asus/C#]lamp unto my [G2]feet [G2]
Your [D]way is the [Asus/C#]only way for [G2]me [G2]
It's a narrow ro[Bm7]ad that leads to li[A(add4)]fe
But I want to be on it [G2] [G2]
It's a narrow ro[Bm7]ad but the mercy's wi[A(add4)]de
‘Cause You're good on Your promise [G2]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I'll [G2]take You at Your [D]word
If You [Asus/C#]said it I'll be[G2]lieve it
I've [G2]seen how good it [D]works
If You [Asus/C#]start it You'll com[G2]plete it
I'll [G2]take You at Your word

You [D]spoke and the [Asus/C#]chaos fell in [G2]line [G2]
Well, I [D]know ‘cause I've [Asus/C#]seen it in my [G2]life [G2]
It's a narrow ro[Bm7]ad that leads to li[A(add4)]fe
But I want to be on it [G2] [G2]
It's a narrow ro[Bm7]ad, the tide is hi[A(add4)]gh
‘Cause You parted the water [G2]

[Asus]You said my future's [Asus]full of Your [Dsus/F#]hope [D/F#]
